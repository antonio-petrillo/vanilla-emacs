#+title: Vanilla emacs config

* My emacs configuration
Heavily inspired by [[https:github.com/lccambiaghi/vanilla-emacs][Luca Cambiaghi]] config and [[https://config.daviwil.com/emacs][David Wilson]] aka [[https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters][System Crafters]].
I'm not sure if I want to drop [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs.git][Doom Emacs]], honestly I will never write a configuration that good and the speed of Doom is unreal, for now I will keep them both and try to improve them.
* Note
Even if I only have 100 package, circa, installed my startup time is two or three time Doom emacs startup time, but with emacs server I don't see any problem with that.
